# Binged

A movie tracking list using enums of watched, watching, and to watch.


Through commit 518b434f8cc5f is following a [tutorial](https://vishnuch.tech/binged-your-movie-watch-tracker-built-using-ruby-on-rails).


I think I'll just incorporate the enum into another project

TODO: 
* Add conditionals for if no movie
* Add in requireds
* Add in testing
* Add in recommended by
* Add in plot summary
* Add in genre
* Add in validation
* Add view helpers
